## 0 - Git and GitHub

Git is a powerful tool of every developer, it makes life easier and saves time. Git simplifies work with version control, provides easy access to history of changes, it can remove fear of irreparable consequences that allow us to experiment with program, gives us opportunity to collaborate, share projects with other people and a lot more.

Course on Udacity had a great educational impact on me, a big pros that it showed different real situations and how they are handeled with Git. Were studied main concepts like commits, staging area, remote repository, branches and GitHub collaboration principles. Important idea of commiting is to understand not only how make a commit but why and how often.

## 1 - Linux CLI, and HTTP

Command line skills are usefull to operate with file directories, every action performed using GUI can be acomplished by line of code in CLI, this allows us to work faster and be ready to situation when graphical interface don't even exist. Also understanding of CLI is crucial to work with Git. Main concepts that I've learned are directory navigating commands like: pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, mv; files operating commands: touch, sort, uniq, grep, sed; output/input redirection commands: cat, >, >>, <, |; and scripting concept that allows us to code frequently used commands.

Articles about HTTP were informative and provided general overview about protocol, headers, client-server communication and was explained the meaning of status codes. The second part of article introduced more detailed information about http connections, namely process of user indentification and authentication, secure protocol and certificates and concept of caching that saves time, cost and improve web-browsing experience. Though text appeared to me a bit tough, I've fixed the result with CS50 lecture about HTTP.
