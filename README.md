Git is a powerful tool of every developer, it simplifies life and saves time. Git simplifies work with version control, provides easy access to history of changes, tt can remove fear of irreparable consequences that allow us to experiment with program, gives us opportunity to collaborate, share projects with other people and a lot more.

Course on Udacity had a great educational impact on me, a big pros that it showed different real situations and how they are handeled with Git. Were studied main concepts like commits, staging area, remote repository, branches and GitHub collaboration principles. Important idea of commiting is to understand not only how make a commit but why and how often.
